6. Document the research process, methodologies, and key findings in a comprehensive report.

## Overview

Technology has significantly impacted the game of golf over the past 20 years. Players are hitting it further than ever before, more consistently, but golf courses have generally remained the same. This project seeks to examine the implications of this technological shift in golf and its potential consequences for various stakeholders.

A key aspect of the project is the proposed rule to rollback the golf ball or reduce its potential to exceed the current mandate set by the USGA, which stipulates that a golf ball cannot exceed 317 yards off the tee. The proposal also includes a bifurcation of the golfing community, wherein professionals and pro-amateurs would use a reduced-flight, regulated golf ball, while recreational players would continue using the current golf ball.

This rule change introduces a complex set of incentives between professionals, equipment companies, and the USGA. Currently, equipment companies can sell golf balls to fans based on the idea that they'll play the same balls as the pros. However, if this relationship no longer exists due to the proposed changes, manufacturers may be less incentivized to optimize their equipment for professionals and reduce their investment in pro endorsements.

The TechGolf Insights project aims to examine the impact of these potential changes and provide insights into the consequences for players, equipment manufacturers, and the overall golfing community. By conducting comprehensive research and analysis, we aim to shed light on the various perspectives and implications related to technology's influence on the game of golf.
